		During this time of crisis with the ongoing pandemic it is important to stay safe this Halloween season. 
		Stay in the spirit of Halloween with JawDropper.  Now you can give  candy to children without even opening  your door .
		The JawDropper is a candy dispenser that can be installed on your front door. With a look that will go perfect with all your other Halloween decorations. 
		It will automatically  dispense candy to children when they are outside your front door. It will greet any trick or treaters with a pre recorded audio message.  
		It will give you info on the amount of candy in the dispenser and notify you when it's running low.
